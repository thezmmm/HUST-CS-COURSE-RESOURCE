Heyï¼Œeveryone,good morning/afternoon,I am previledged to present here.

Today,I want to talk something about the reason why I want to master English well. I know, you think I merely want to
pass the College English Tests,but Is that really the case?NO,no,no,not only do I want to pass the exam ,but also I hope 
I can enter into a foreign company to escape 996 work schedule.

Although the above is the main,but the next question also puzzles me.It is variable.Everyday,when I see many varibles,
I am in chaos.So I need English to record the meaning of the varibles.

All things considered, I think you have known why I would like to learn English well.

Thanks for listening.
