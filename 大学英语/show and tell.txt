	Today, I would like to show my smart phone. 
Everyone has it, but no one show it.
	Now, moblie phones are already a necessity, 
and i can't go out without it, because its functions are 
really important, i can do all sorts of things with it.
	First, i can make a purchase with mobile payment.
And then, i can use it instead of watch to see the time.And  
sometimes i don't want to eat out, so i can order takeout 
with it.And next i can use qq or wechat to contact others 
in spite of the long distance.And now, everyweek we do nucleic 
acid tests, and we need health code to prove healthy.
	There are countless things it can do, and the list is endless.
	But it's not perfect. Althrough , i can use it for 
entertainment , sometimes i ignored how much time i 
spent,so something that had to be done were not done 
and i even missed deadline.
	There is nothing wrong with smart phone,
 only usage can be wrong.
	Thanks. That's all.
